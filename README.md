# graphs-maps
A maps application which will calculate the shortest path between different points using various graph searching algorithms such as Dijkstra, A*, and BFS.


Module 1:

        1: Implemented degreeSequence() method in Graph.java class.

        2: Implemented getDistance2 method in both GraphAdjList and GraphAdjMatrix.
        
Module 2:

        1: Implemented class hierarchy to create nodes and edges for graph implementation. Implemented the MapNode and MapEdge classes.

        2: Implemented all methods tagged TODO in the MapGraph class (implemented the graph data structure.)

        3: Implemented a Breadth First Search algorithm for the graph.

Module 3: 

        1: Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

        2: Implemented the A* search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

        3: Compared outcomes of running both algorithms on test data.

The ultimate goal of these modules was to understand the graph data structure and related topics such as the Traveling Salesperson problem, Hamiltonian graphs, and Eurlerian graphs. The goal was also to understand the differences between different searching algorithms for graphs. Between Dijkstra and A*, the A* algorithm ends up being superior due to the use of heuristics. While Dijkstra searches nearly every possible route and spends a lot of time doing this, the A* algorithm essentially makes an educated guess as to what route to pursue, and saves a lot of time with this strategy.
